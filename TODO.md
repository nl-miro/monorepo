GOAL: support proxies


Status follows the [TODO workflow](AGENTS.md#todo-workflow):

| Marker | Phase                      |
| ------ | -------------------------- |
| `[ ]`  | Pending                    |
| `[.]`  | Planning in progress       |
| `[>]`  | Planning complete          |
| `[~]`  | Implementation in progress |
| `[x]`  | Implemented                |

Flow: `[ ]` → `[.]` → `[>]` → `[~]` → `[x]`.


NOTES:
- We are aware that `For now` is going against ADR-16, but this is shortterm
- depending on local mulac will be needed in this phase and possibly next ones
- `customer-facing` will take given events and persist them into `offers` table

- [~] Rotate offer downloads across direct access and configured proxies.
