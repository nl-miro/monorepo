Shipping data: `Shipping countries` retains the existing documented coverage.
The separate Shopify shipping-configuration survey remains in the
[research evidence](research/retailer-shipping-countries-2026-11-13.json), rather
than in the retailer entity or inventory tables. Configured countries do not
guarantee checkout eligibility or delivery for every product/address.
The Anker EU shipping row was previously reconciled with this configuration and
retains its explicit policy-conflict note. Dated checks supersede older claims of
unknown Ugreen UK/US endpoints; older research prose remains historical evidence.

Main locale tables contain existing storefront locales and explicitly verified
contexts. Advertised-only tables identify unconfirmed entries through their header;
they are shown only when nonempty. Main does not imply a selected collection
country or verified pricing. Both tables retain their evidence annotations.

Verification update (2026-11-13): [per-locale evidence and results](research/retailer-context-verification-2026-11-13.json).
Eight previously unselected rows have matching page language, Shopify backend,
page country and explicit Storefront API context responses. They are marked
`context verified 2026-11-13`. This verifies localization, not shipping eligibility,
price uniqueness, complete translation, or collection priority. Other rows remain
unselected: blocked requests are not evidence that a locale is unsupported.
Earlier research notes below describe the original survey; the dated evidence
supersedes them only for rows explicitly verified here. Runtime initial-fill collection uses only the main-table locales through
`Retailer.supported_locales`; advertised-only entries remain research. A main-table
locale without a country is collected with country omitted, using its declared
GraphQL language. Currency is observed in responses. See
[ADR 69](adr/0069-inventory-initial-fill-contexts.md).

**Pricing decision:** Use Austria's country code (`AT`) to retrieve all Anker
Europe catalog prices from `ankereu.myshopify.com`, with
`@inContext(country: AT, language: EN)`. Use these returned EUR prices for the
Anker Europe price feed.

Croatia has observed price differences, but we intentionally disregard them
and will not collect a separate Croatian price feed. Poland returns prices in
Polish złoty (`PLN`); those prices will be handled separately, outside this
Austria-based EUR feed. This is our chosen collection policy, not a claim that
every country's actual prices are identical.

The GraphQL country/region and GraphQL language columns specify the intended collection context; Supported locales retains the website locale tags. Here, `AT` / `EN` is the selected pricing context for the `en-EU` storefront. Contexts elsewhere in this inventory are not claimed to be live-verified unless explicitly noted.


**Shipping verification (2026-11-13):** The storefront's embedded
`props.pageProps.shop.shipsToCountries` and a direct Storefront API
`shop { shipsToCountries }` query both return the 24 destinations above.
[Saved response](research/ankereu-shipping-countries-2026-11-13.json).
The [English shipping policy](https://www.anker.com/eu-en/policies/shipping-policy)
still lists only eight countries; it conflicts with the structured shipping
configuration. The list above uses that configuration rather than expanding
localization markets or interpreting product exclusions as shipping coverage.
It does not guarantee delivery of every product to every address. The Austria
pricing-context decision is independent and remains unchanged.

**Research notes:** Official Primary Market / Language table; not inferred from Shopify.country. Source: docs/research/retailer-localization-2026-11-09.json (2026-11-09). Target markets above retain the source-declared storefront markets; they are not an API country enumeration or a shipping-derived market list. GraphQL country/region and GraphQL language are intended collection contexts, not verified API combinations. No catalog-price comparison has been performed for this retailer in this extension. The research verified the GraphQL QueryRoot only; available country/language combinations still need a localization query. A collection country has not been selected. EU labels the regional storefront and is not a Shopify CountryCode; the Anker Europe AT pricing decision does not apply here. Rows in the advertised-only tables are alternate links, not verified locale pages or confirmed extra content requests. Their country contexts remain unselected, and the base Shopify backend has not been established for those URLs.

**Research notes:** Source: docs/research/retailer-localization-2026-11-09.json (2026-11-09). Target markets above retain the source-declared storefront markets; they are not an API country enumeration or a shipping-derived market list. GraphQL country/region and GraphQL language are intended collection contexts, not verified API combinations. No catalog-price comparison has been performed for this retailer in this extension. The research verified the GraphQL QueryRoot only; available country/language combinations still need a localization query. A collection country has not been selected. EU labels the regional storefront and is not a Shopify CountryCode; the Anker Europe AT pricing decision does not apply here. Rows in the advertised-only tables are alternate links, not verified locale pages or confirmed extra content requests. Their country contexts remain unselected, and the base Shopify backend has not been established for those URLs.

**Shipping evidence:** Status: unknown. No reliable enumerated shipping-country definition established in the reviewed sources.

**Research notes:** Source: docs/research/retailer-localization-2026-11-09.json (2026-11-09). Target markets above retain the source-declared storefront markets; they are not an API country enumeration or a shipping-derived market list. GraphQL country/region and GraphQL language are intended collection contexts, not verified API combinations. No catalog-price comparison has been performed for this retailer in this extension. The research verified the GraphQL QueryRoot only; available country/language combinations still need a localization query. Rows in the advertised-only tables are alternate links, not verified locale pages or confirmed extra content requests. Their country contexts remain unselected, and the base Shopify backend has not been established for those URLs.
